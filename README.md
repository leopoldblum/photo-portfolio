# photo portfolio

### ideas:

#### basic top bar
- stuck to top
- LB / home  
- instagram / contact

#### Project based arrangement 
    
- cover pic(s)
- click to redirect to site with that project
- hover name/description of project
- rather dark, minimalist

#### Layout cards:

- row based
- 1 row = 1 project? / each pic has own project linked? / hybrid?
- each row has either:
    - 1 giant pic stretched across
    
    - 2 pics side by side:
        - 1 landscape, 1 portrait
        - 2 portrait

    
#### extras
- scroll to top button
- image carousels
- cursor animation shenanigans?
